# STOOZER
In this project we'll build a wallet-like app that will tell us what type of credit card Purchase Card to get, and what the status of the stoozing on each card is.

# Core Capabilities 
- [ ] Whether the card is a small purchase window or whether purchase window spans length of introductory period
- [ ] Inputs for how much interest the user is gaining in their savings account, and so we can calculate the value of using the credit card for stoozing.
- [ ] Calendar creation events to remind us when to pay off the card.
- [ ] Graphs showing the cost of the card if the deadline is missed. 
- [ ] Graphs showing the spending window (either 60 days, or entire length of intro period) as well as when to spend, how close we're tracking to credit limit, and when to pay it off.
- [ ] Maths on how to pay-off the card (equal installments after purchase window or all-at-once at the end)
- [ ] The details of card. 
- [ ] The Provider (barclaycard, natwest).
- [ ] The details for the login (apple passwords?) for that app 
- [ ] open banking integrations to keep track of credit card balance.
- [ ] Total profit gained per card, and for all cards.
- [ ] What purchase cards are available on the market
- [ ] Total debt
  - [ ] Total savings reserved
  - [ ] A warning if savings are less than debt balance (not true arbitrage)
- [ ] What the important terms & conditions are for each brand of card
- [ ] See how much is potential on the card if the full credit limit is used
- [ ] Warnings when credit limits are close
- [ ] Calendar showing payments dates of all cards
- [ ] Notes section on each card
- [ ] The available interest and terms and credit limit for each card
- [ ] See how much money I'm making on each card
